With sensitivity and care, the tracks of the now double album were shredded by limiter, compressors and distractors. The ears of the listeners should already bleed massively, what else would become of the image.\
.N3<øMΔ†Δ. drags you into the depths of the darkest noise atmosphere with their new and first tape. Once there, they stretch out their claws and summon fat beats of the underworld with loud screaming.
