«Trip Me Tender», was released back in 2011 years. Still somewhat rough around the edges, still exploring and finding their path, Viaticum wrote songs with somehow disturbing titles and lyrics («Fuck The Bird», «Bury The Child») and took turns in experimenting with different styles and genres while keeping their spheric and somewhat gloomy attitude. There's some hard and noisey stuff, there are some lovely melodies and there's even some acapella. Not very sunshiny acapella though. Still, this is some heavy rock.
