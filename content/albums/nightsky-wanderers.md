After humbly realizing that dreams are indeed finite, Strobehazer gets into his 69â€™ Mustang and races back to his cyberspace home, crossing galaxies of inner turmoil and cohesion, all while chanting an ode to us, the peasants of everyday life. But before he knows it, a shroud of haze and the bright strobelight captures him yet again. A glittering figure is about to emerge.
