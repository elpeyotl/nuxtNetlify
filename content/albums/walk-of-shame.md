**Lyrics**\

The monkeys start hunting me 
in the morning when you're gone 
Urging to get more of it 
but I don't know, where to run 

I spent all my money on you 
and now please, don't get me wrong 
I just never hesitate 
when you just play along 

The walk of shame is long indeed 
but I'll take it, 'cos back home I've got all I need 
Why don't you join me? 

I ran around all the blocks 
bleeding my lungs out for a dime 
and the monkeys get off my back 
as I commit another crime 

To figure out where to go 
a shady lead is not plan
we'll end up heads in a sink 
taking back out all that we can

The walk of shame is long indeed 
but I'll take it, 'cos back home I've got all I need 
Why don't you join me? 

But as we got home
the monkeys were waiting 
they were napping away the rush
A Tigress in bed 
more standing than laying 
and hitting on my MasterKush 
The rythm is fading but my pump keeps the beat 
I'm wondering who else I'm gonna meet 
The lights are coliding and soon I'll be out
again to fuel the crowd

A high noon is riding the skies 
it's like if you were never gone
for a minute or for a short song
I thought we could be as one 
I spent a day with you 
for every night I leave behind 
a whole fuckin day with you
 'cos you are always on my mind 

The walk of shame is long indeed 
but I'll take it, 'cos back home I've got all I need 
Why don't you join me? 

But as we got home
the monkeys were waiting 
they were napping away the rush
A Tigress in bed 
more standing than laying 
and hitting on my MasterKush 
The rythm is fading but my pump keeps the beat 
I'm wondering who else I'm gonna meet 
The lights are coliding and soon I'll be out\
