This is not a happy song. However, it is soothing, listening to Migre le tigre sing about staying home and choosing darkness in solitude over a familiar face, as there are moments in life when we have to be alone with our own demons before being able to welcome other people into our lives. Again: This is not a happy song. But at certain times, this is the rightÂ song.
