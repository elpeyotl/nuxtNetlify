  No time to catch your breath,

  no encore(s), sing what needs to be said.

  Exactly where Darkwave, Synthpunk and Electro meet, they stand with

  jagged sawtooth waves. Driving, dark and extremely danceable.

  The lyrics are in German and Swiss German and are sometimes dark, sometimes angry.

  sometimes dark, sometimes angry, sometimes cynical, sometimes thoughtful.

  They deal with modern society and its basic values in a critical and resistant manner.

  society and its basic values.
