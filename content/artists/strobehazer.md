description: " A glittering figure emerging from a shroud of haze, stepping into
  the stroboscope light, Strobehazer is sent straight from the 80s to abduct you
  into a vibrant realm of Synthesizers and neon lights, spandex pants and wild
  nights that never end."
biography: Since Strobehazer’s first encounter with 80s music in his early
  childhood, an ever growing nostalgia for that decade’s music has been evoked,
  resulting in this very Synth-pop project and the release of a first single
  entitled FINITE DREAMS. Influenced by the 70s and 80s AOR- and Pop-giants,
  combined with a Heavy Metal aesthetic, Strobehazer creates danceable ballads
  evoking simpler times.
