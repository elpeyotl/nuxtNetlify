description: The Hathors were the apprentices in the temple of the goddess
  Hathor in ancient Egypt. Today it's a rock band signed at Noisolution.
biography: "Some rock bands carry the burden of the world on their shoulders.
  Others just want to party. Hathors used to be firmly parked in the former
  camp. No longer! Hathors have made a discovery: Life isn’t life if there isn’t
  also a little light and love involved. The title of their new album gives it
  away, “Grief, Roses and Gasoline”. Roses? Anger about all sorts of social
  injustice (“Grief”) and sadness about the way we abuse the environment
  (“Gasoline”), like guitars, bass and drums, have been a part of Hathors from
  the very beginning. The roses, however, they are fresh. They stand for a
  warmer strand of emotions, a new lust for life, that flows through the album
  even when it makes the walls shake.\r

  Aged fourteen, Marc Bouffé discovered Nirvana. “I loved the screaming. It
  felt cathartic”, he says, “like a soul singer giving free reign to his
  feelings.” He borrowed his sister’s guitar, learnt two chords and started his
  first band: “To be on stage with your best friends, travel the world, and do
  with your life what you really want to – it became my dream.” Remarkably, the
  dream soon became reality. Just as swiftly, Bouffé threw off the shackles of
  grunge to follow his own vision of a guitar-driven high-octane rock sound
  where each riff and each lick served not the ego, but the song.

  The Hathors were the apprentices in the temple of the goddess Hathor in
  ancient Egypt. Apart from the arts, she was also looking after love, death and
  the pleasures of intoxication. Is there a more perfect name for a rock band?
  The modern Hathors’ debut album was released in 2011. A superior offering of
  post-grunge rock, it garnered plenty of praise, especially in the
  French-speaking world. However, the production felt just a little too
  streamlined to the band, too controlled to be true. Their second album
  “Brainwash” (2013) was their incendiary response: more sweat, more mistakes,
  and more life. “Panem et Circenses” followed in 2017, still raw but a little
  more subtle…

  “Grief, Roses and Gasoline” starts with a surprise: The lyrics of “Where
  Were You” may bemoan the soulless rat race of modern performance society, but
  the song rattles along with such joyous abandon – not to mention a cheeky
  na-na-na-na chorus – that any feelings of frustration are instantly banished.
  And that’s just the beginning. What follows is a bubbling cauldron of deep and
  urgent rhythms, crisp choruses, and moods that range from soulfully thoughtful
  to exuberantly angry, all the way to simply euphoric. With this album, the
  band has found the perfect balance between the raw energy of their live shows
  and a love of detail that can only be forged in the studio.

  “Grief, Roses and Gasoline” was recorded in four months in the band’s studio
  in Winterthur, a small but musical town near Zurich. “With this album we have
  almost arrived back where we started”, says Bouffé: “Except now we have
  complete control over our recordings and the type of aesthetic we want to go
  for. And we had a massive craving for memorable and carefully produced songs
  that were also spikey and hard-hitting…” After the band had done their work,
  John Goodmanson (Bikini Kill, Pavement, Wu-Tang Clan) rounded it off with a
  brilliant mix in his studio in Seattle.\r
