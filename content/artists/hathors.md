description: The Hathors were the apprentices in the temple of the goddess
  Hathor in ancient Egypt. Today it's a rock band signed at Noisolution.
biography: "Aged fourteen, Marc Bouffé discovered Nirvana. “I loved the
  screaming. It felt cathartic”, he says, “like a soul singer giving free reign
  to his feelings.” He borrowed his sister’s guitar, learnt two chords and
  started his first band: “To be on stage with your best friends, travel the
  world, and do with your life what you really want to – it became my dream.”
  Remarkably, the dream soon became reality. Just as swiftly, Bouffé threw off
  the shackles of grunge to follow his own vision of a guitar-driven high-octane
  rock sound where each riff and each lick served not the ego, but the song."
