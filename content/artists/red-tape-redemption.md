biography: >-
  The project started as a One-Man-Band by Lukas Oberholzer in 2019 since his
  former band Coffee For The Restless broke up. After a few solo shows, his
  former CFTR band colleague Tobias Kalt picked up the drumstick to join forces
  – Red Tape Redemption started rock ‘n’ rolling. 

  In December 2020 their debut EP DRIVING SOUTH was released digitally through THE YELLING LIGHT.
