biography: 'Amagortis was formed in 2001 by Daniel, Stoef, Nathalie and friends.
  In January of 2004 Amagortis self-released their first full length album
  "Abominable". The line-up for this recording and the following gigs was:
  Daniel (Guitar and backing vocals), Grimm (Vocals), Stoef (Drums) and Nathalie
  (Bass). In 2006 Pascal replaced Grimm on vocals, bringing a more guttural and
  brutal style to the band. Influenced by the world-wide death metal scene the
  band gained more and more live-experience and the music became more brutal and
  faster than before. In December of 2007 Amagortis released their second full
  length album "Pre-Natal Cannibalism" containing 11 tracks of slamming guttural
  brutality. In support of the album the band toured in the USA and the UK and
  has played a number of gigs and festivals in Germany, Holland, Russia and of
  course Switzerland. After the departure of Stoef and Nathalie, the line-up
  today consists of Daniel (Guitar and backing vocals), Pascal (Vocals), Ruppi
  (Drums) and Marc (Bass). The band released their third full length album
  entitled "Intrinsic Indecency" in August 2010. During 2011 Amagortis toured
  trough Europe, playing 26 shows in 28 days supporting Gorgasm and Defeated
  Sanity. Before and after this tour, the Band played different festivals as
  well as many club shows. All the while rehearsing and writing new songs. A
  Demo with 3 new mind crushing songs has been released in february 2012.'
