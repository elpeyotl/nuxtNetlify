  band gained more and more live-experience and the music became more brutal and
  faster than before. In December of 2007 Amagortis released their second full

  brutality. In support of the album the band toured in the USA and the UK and
  has played a number of gigs and festivals in Germany, Holland, Russia and of

  entitled "Intrinsic Indecency" in August 2010. During 2011 Amagortis toured
  trough Europe, playing 26 shows in 28 days supporting Gorgasm and Defeated
  Sanity. Before and after this tour, the Band played different festivals as
