description: The four members of Viaticum, old friends since early youth, while
  meanwhile living wildly spread across Switzerland create soundscapes which
  cannot be categorized. They call their music Kosmikrock- deeply rooted in
  psychedelic Krautrock of the 1970s crossed with Spacerock and other genres
  with loud, playful and intense guitar riffs.
biography: "The history of Viaticum started 2005 in an old vaulted cellar where
  Pascal and Michi started to play jam sessions as a guitar duo. Later Urs, the
  bass player, joined the guitarists and together they rocked the cellar night
  after night. More and more musicians joined the sessions which lead to wild
  musical experiments including keyboard, organ and percussion. Over the time
  song structures started growing out of those wild and vibrant jam sessions and
  the band name was aspirated into the sticky cellar air: Viaticum was born. For
  the young musicians their music embodied the supplies for the path towards the
  beyond, like the viaticum itself. The first demo songs were followed by some
  changes in the line-up and Bastian joined as new drummer. With this line-up
  2011 the EP TRIP ME TENDER was released under Acoustic Desaster Records. On
  this record Viaticum defined their own style and built their overall Sound.
  The band called the young genre Kosmikrock, which was described by STONEROBIXX
  as «interesting mix of space, psychedelic, kraut, prog, & psychedelic rock».
  2014 the self-released album KOSMIKROCK was born. Compared to the more basic
  sound of TRIP ME TENDER, the music on KOSMIKROCK became deeper: The songs got
  wider and more complex. With the new record, Viaticum toured for the first
  time. After that, the band members had a lot of private stuff to handle and
  after almost ten years, drummer Bastian left the band. New drummer Dave was a
  worthy successor. His reduced drumming should shape the new album SOLAR
  TRANSIENT and Viaticum’s future. Viaticum’s sound became again more
  down-to-earth without loosing the psychedelic influence. It was a long rocky
  road until the band found itself again and could create new ideas and songs
  out of long spacy jams. After the recordings of the new album, Dave left
  Viaticum and gave the sticks to Jöni, an old friend of the band. Since 2019 he
  contributes his fresh rhythms to Viaticum’s sound. The climax of this moved
  episode in the band’s recent history is called SOLAR TRANSIENT, their new
  album – fresh off the press!"

Viaticum, Solar Transient: Some things take their time to grow. Like the Giant Himalayan Lily or the Kurinji Plant. Or the Madagascar Palm. Or «Solar Transient», Viaticums latest release. After six years, the four men from Winterthur finally got to put out a new album, recorded by Verwaltzen Productions. According to the band, the album didn't come to them easily and «has taken many hurdles to finally be there». And now it doesn't come to us easily. It took time to create and it takes time to listen. Not only because the songs on «Solar Transient» are – with one exception – roughly eleven minutes long, but rather because the music brought to us by Viaticum on this record isn't like some light beer or wine cooler to sip while watching the sunset. It's obscure, tangled, nebulous, disturbing at times while on the other hand comfortingly soft and simply beautiful. Powerful and yet with a great sense of distress, the four songs are reminders of getting lost in the dark and not being sure whether you really want to find your way back home. «Solar Transient» was originally released in fall 2020, perfectly matching the mood swings, frustrations and wishes of said very weird and especially confusing times. Even though the songs had been written a long time before a pandemic rolled around and changed our lives for good. Now that summer is coming, there is hope the band will get to play these songs on stage some day soon. Until then, we can listen to «Solar Transient» through pretty much every channel we feel comfortable with and take up residence in the imaginary place this record built.
