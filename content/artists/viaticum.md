description: The four members of Viaticum, old friends since early youth, while
  meanwhile living wildly spread across Switzerland create soundscapes which
  cannot be categorized. They call their music Kosmikrock- deeply rooted in
  psychedelic Krautrock of the 1970s crossed with Spacerock and other genres
  with loud, playful and intense guitar riffs.
biography: "The history of Viaticum started 2005 in an old vaulted cellar where
  Pascal and Michi started to play jam sessions as a guitar duo. Later Urs, the
  bass player, joined the guitarists and together they rocked the cellar night
  after night. More and more musicians joined the sessions which lead to wild
  musical experiments including keyboard, organ and percussion. Over the time
  song structures started growing out of those wild and vibrant jam sessions and
  the band name was aspirated into the sticky cellar air: Viaticum was born. For
  the young musicians their music embodied the supplies for the path towards the
  beyond, like the viaticum itself. The first demo songs were followed by some
  changes in the line-up and Bastian joined as new drummer. With this line-up
  2011 the EP TRIP ME TENDER was released under Acoustic Desaster Records. On
  this record Viaticum defined their own style and built their overall Sound.
  The band called the young genre Kosmikrock, which was described by STONEROBIXX
  as «interesting mix of space, psychedelic, kraut, prog, & psychedelic rock».
  2014 the self-released album KOSMIKROCK was born. Compared to the more basic
  sound of TRIP ME TENDER, the music on KOSMIKROCK became deeper: The songs got
  wider and more complex. With the new record, Viaticum toured for the first
  time. After that, the band members had a lot of private stuff to handle and
  after almost ten years, drummer Bastian left the band. New drummer Dave was a
  worthy successor. His reduced drumming should shape the new album SOLAR
  TRANSIENT and Viaticum’s future. Viaticum’s sound became again more
  down-to-earth without loosing the psychedelic influence. It was a long rocky
  road until the band found itself again and could create new ideas and songs
  out of long spacy jams. After the recordings of the new album, Dave left
  Viaticum and gave the sticks to Jöni, an old friend of the band. Since 2019 he
  contributes his fresh rhythms to Viaticum’s sound. The climax of this moved
  episode in the band’s recent history is called SOLAR TRANSIENT, their new
  album – fresh off the press!"
