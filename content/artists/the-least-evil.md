description: The Least Evil is a fresh Rock Duo from Winterthur, Switzerland.
biography: "Andy and Simon know each other since 2002, while being in several
  punk, metal and grunge bands. In 2014, they started their own project. The
  Least Evil was born. Andy, the former bassist and back vocalist changed to the
  guitar and lead vocal. Simon kept doing what he does best: playing the drums.
  From then on, they played as a two-man-band for their headbanging fans. They
  describe their sound as energetic, diversified, melodic post-grunge. In May
  2020 Gian joined the group supporting the band on the bass."
