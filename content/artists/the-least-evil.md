biography: >-
  The two protagonists of The Least Evil have known each other since 2002, when
  they played together in a punk metal band. They quickly understood that the
  same blood - driven by music - runs through their veins. Andy: "I can blindly
  trust Seimen on the drums, he knows when the transition is coming, even though
  we have never played the song, we just speak the same language!" The band
  broke up, but the two never lost sight of each other musically. \

  Meanwhile, Andy swapped bass for guitar and back vocals for lead vocals. \

  After a small concert among colleagues at the end of 2016, they were pushed to showcase their skills on stage. It can't be that bad, they thought, and thus the band name The Least Evil was sealed.
