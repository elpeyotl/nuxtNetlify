The important thing is that you feel the music in your gut when you listen to Nongativ. For years, music was written depending on the form of the day and mood, with time several projects crystallized. With Nongativ Sirius deals with mental abysses and aggression. This deep whimsical ambient mixed with death and black metal parts requires a certain openness. It is a way to experience the beauty behind all the darkness from this perspective.
