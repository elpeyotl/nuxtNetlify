In the summer, the talented [JARLS](https://www.theyellinglight.ch/artists/jarls/) released their first single, "WATER LOVE," followed by their self-titled debut album on December 1st.


A new addition to The Yelling Light circle is [THE KUSHAN EMPIRE](https://www.theyellinglight.ch/artists/the-kushan-empire). The young band from Zurich recently dropped their single "PSILENCE" — a trippy and groovy track exploring interpersonal relationships, letting go, and the tales of "Vega" and "Altair."


The emerging rock band [RED TAPE REDEMPTION](https://www.theyellinglight.ch/artists/red-tape-redemption) continues its creative journey, proudly presenting their brand-new studio EP, "OLLIE OSBOURNE" on December 1, 2023. This EP weaves raw guitar riffs with catchy melodies, combining energy and passion in five powerful songs.


In November, I had the opportunity of taking photos at the second Noise Fest featuring KØDE, Powder for Pigeons, and Dÿse. A big thanks for this cool assignment, Marc & Hathors!


Also, big thanks to everyone who came at the yelling light release night with VERWALTZEN, RED TAPE REDEMPTION & JARLS at lokal Winterthur. It was a fantastic, yelling night. 


So long, hang on.
