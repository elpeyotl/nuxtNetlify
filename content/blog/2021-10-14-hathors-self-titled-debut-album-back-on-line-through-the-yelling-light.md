Without Hathors, The yelling light would never have seen the light of day. For almost 10 years, countless concerts and wonderful memories I can count Marc and the Hathors to my favorite artists and especially to my friends <3

These atmospheric songs from the self-titled album have accompanied me for years.  That's why I recommend everyone who reads this text here to listen to the album (again, and again) consciously, because raw music about love & hate is really good for everyone.
