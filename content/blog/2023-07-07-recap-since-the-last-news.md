It's been a while since the last news article was published. But, The yelling light was by no means idle during that time.\
\
With **[Tar Pond](https://www.theyellinglight.ch/photography/tar-pond/)**, **[Megaton Sword](https://www.theyellinglight.ch/photography/megaton-sword/)** and **[IRR](https://www.theyellinglight.ch/photography/irr/)** we managed to photograph some fantastic Artists and also some old pictures made it on our website.\
\
In the meantime, **[.N3<ØMΔ†Δ.](https://www.theyellinglight.ch/artists/n3-%C3%B8m%CE%B4%E2%80%A0%CE%B4/)** and **[Anthropozän](https://www.theyellinglight.ch/artists/anthropoz%C3%A4n/)** have been added to the roster. In addition, the two hardworking gentlemen of **[Red Tape Redemption](https://www.theyellinglight.ch/artists/red-tape-redemption/)** have released a new EP with two songs.\
\
The latest addition to The yelling light are **[Butchers of Lassie](https://www.theyellinglight.ch/artists/butchers-of-lassie/)**, a three-dog combo from Endhöri. And with them, they have two releases in their luggage, namely "B.o.L" and exactly today "Wahnfried Hinschied" is released on all streaming plattforms.
