I am very happy to be able to help Sirius Haltmeier with the release of Nongativ. \
\
Sirius is an artist with a lot of potential. With Nongativ he now makes his first solo project available on all streaming portals. \
\
This deep whimsical ambient mixed with death and black metal parts requires a certain openness. It is a way to experience the beauty behind all the darkness from this perspective.
