It starts off with a rather gloomy guitar riff, while then letting in a little light by adding some chords with a slight leaning to brightness. Since people are usually more used to the encouraging lyrics and hopeful melodies, this is a slightly different approach to an unpleasant topic in the life of a musician. In this sense, let us conquer the pain. Even if it wins now andÂ then.
